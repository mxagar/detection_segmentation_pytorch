# Beyond Image Classification: Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation with Pytorch

This repository collects examples in which [*Object Detection*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_detection) and [*Semantic Segmentation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_segmentation) are applied with [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/).

The most known application of Convolutional Neural Networks is *Image Classification*: an image is convoluted with several trained filters to output a vector of `N` values; each value is a float between `0` and `1` and it denotes the probability of the image containing one of the pre-defined `N` classes of objects.

However, there are also architectures

## Overview and File Structure

### How to Use This

TBD.
### Dependencies

You should create a python environment (e.g., with [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)) and install the dependencies listed in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.

A short summary of commands required to have all in place is the following:

```bash
conda create -n faces python=3.6
conda activate faces
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch 
conda install pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
