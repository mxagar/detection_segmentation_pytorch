# YOLO v3 with Darknet

YOLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection algorithm. In this notebook, the YOLO model is applied to detect objects in images.

The code from this notebook has its origin in the Udacity repository [deep-learning-v2-pytorch](https://github.com/mxagar/deep-learning-v2-pytorch).

Note that the implementation uses [Darknet](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/), not Pytorch!
